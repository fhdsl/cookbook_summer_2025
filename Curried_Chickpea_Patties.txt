Ingredients
* 1 (15.5 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 1 small onion, about ½ cup, chopped
* 1 clove of garlic, minced
* 4 eggs
* ½ cup breadcrumbs
* ¼ cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped
* 2 teaspoons lemon zest
* ½ teaspoon paprika
* 2 teaspoons curry powder
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* Whole-wheat pita pockets or large lettuce leaves (optional, for serving)
For the yogurt sauce:
* ½ cup Greek yogurt
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon fresh mint, chopped
* Salt and pepper, to taste
Directions
1. Combine chickpeas, onions, garlic, and eggs in a food processor. Blend until the mixture has the texture of a chunky hummus, leaving some large chickpea pieces.
2. Transfer the chickpea mixture to a large bowl and combine with the remaining ingredients. Mix well. Form into 4 patties or up to 12 small patties if you want to eat in a pita pocket or lettuce wrap. The mixture should be very wet to ensure a moist patty, but if you are having trouble forming them, stir in more breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon at a time.
3. Combine all ingredients for the yogurt sauce. Taste for seasoning and set aside.
4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop the patties into the pan with space in between. Do this in batches if necessary. Cook for 5 minutes, then carefully flip and cook the other side for another 5 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Serve on a warm pita pocket or in a lettuce wrap with the yogurt sauce.
