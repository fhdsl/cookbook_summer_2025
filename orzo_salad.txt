Ingredients:
8 oz orzo pasta
1 cup green peas
1½ cups chopped asparagus
4–5 cups fresh arugula leaves
3 tbsp chopped fresh basil
3 tbsp chopped fresh mint
4 oz crumbled feta cheese
Salt and pepper to taste

Dressing:
⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil
1 large or 2 small shallots, peeled and thinly sliced

2 tbsp red wine vinegar
Juice and zest of half a lemon
1 tsp honey
½ tsp Dijon mustard
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Prepare the Shallot Vinaigrette:
In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced shallots and sauté until golden brown, being careful not to burn them. Transfer the shallots and oil to a jar or bowl. Add red wine vinegar, lemon juice and zest, honey, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Whisk until well combined. Set aside to allow flavors to meld.

Cook the Orzo:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the orzo and cook according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

Blanch the Vegetables:
In the same pot, bring water back to a boil. Add the green peas and chopped asparagus. Cook for 2–3 minutes until bright green and tender-crisp. Immediately drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain again.

Assemble the Salad:
In a large bowl, combine the cooked orzo, blanched peas, asparagus, arugula, basil, mint, and crumbled feta. Drizzle with the prepared shallot vinaigrette and toss gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve:
Serve immediately for a fresh and vibrant dish. Alternatively, refrigerate for up to 4 days. The flavors develop even more after a day.
